## Task Force Charter: Sponsorship Exploration Task Force

Approval date: 2019-05-16 [Motion](https://github.com/carpentries/executive-council-info/issues/12)
Completion date: 

### Context

The sustainability of The Carpentries relies on community, revenue and partnerships. With now one year of The Carpentries, we have a better understanding of our revenue and expenses. Through programs we are generating approximately 59% of our current operational expenses. As a not for profit project, we have the opportunity to generate revenue to support our mission not only through programs, but also through sponsorships and donations. Revenue generated in this way can be unencumbered and used for general operational expenses, or encumbered for specific programs. 

Sponsorships are more than just donations, they encourage communication and crossover between the sponsoring and receiving groups, inviting the sponsor to share the vision of our organization and investing in our long term sustainability.  A Sponsorship Model would allow us to establish sustainable relationships and generate potentially consistent funding from sponsors. As Sponsors would be a part of us achieving our vision, our Sponsorship Model would need to include a way to evaluate and establish relationships that are in line with our mission and values. Through developing a general model, we could get community input and feedback on the model, so that the Sponsorship program is supported by the community, but the entire community does not need to weigh in on each Sponsorship proposal. 

### Objective

The objective of this task force is to collect information and develop ideas and considersations for a Sponsorship model that would create relationships with organizations that align with our community and organisational values.

### Deliverables

- A report with considerations for a Sponsorship program and recommendations on how a pilot could be developed.
