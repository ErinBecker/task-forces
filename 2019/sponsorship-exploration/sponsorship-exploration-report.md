## The Carpentries Sponsorship Evaluation Task Force Recommendations

**Background and Objectives**

[The Sponsorship Exploration Task Force](https://github.com/carpentries/task-forces/blob/master/2019/sponsorship-exploration/sponsorship-exploration-project-charter.md) has been evaluating The Carpentries approach to Sponsorship and the CarpentryCon 2020 Budget Subcommittee has been developing a model for sponsorship for CarpentryCon 2020.

While, overall we are thinking about Sponsorship for The Carpentries organisation, the Task Force has agreed that rather than starting with organisational sponsorship, we should pilot a sponsorship approach for CarpentryCon 2020.

There are a few elements to consider for Sponsorship, with our recommendations for each component outlined below

- Sponsorship levels and what will be included at each level
- The process for people applying for or requesting to sponsor the event
- The Sponsorship agreement
- Sponsorship Policy
- Thanking Sponsors
- General Sponsorship or donation requests
- Evaluation of the pilot

### Sponsorship Levels

The CarpentryCon 2020 Task Force has been working on a Sponsorship Levels document.

Recommendations from the Sponsorship Task Force are to have a limited number of public options, have lower bounds for the funding level rather than ranges, and to not commit to making products, or just 1 or 2 products, with the sponsors name on them, because it can be a logistical challenge to make them. Also, the Sponsorship team can be open to ‘in kind’ contributions where the company offers to make something like badges or mugs for us.

### Application process and evaluation

The Sponsorship Task Force is recommending a ‘sponsorship application process’ that allows us to ask a few questions of the potential sponsoring organisation, to see how they align with our community and give some context for their sponsorship. We do want Sponsorships to be related and relevant. While we want to ensure their organisation is in line with our values, it would be challenging to create and evaluate certain elements of the organisation through an application with a few questions. However, we can use the application as an opportunity for us to articulate our values, and for the company to acknowledge that they’re aware of them by checking a box in the application.

In evaluating a Sponsorship application some designated set of people (perhaps the CarpentryCon Sponsorship Task Force) will review the application and do some due diligence, including but not limited to searching for general information on the organisation and its leadership to identify any potential areas of concern that would warrant further consideration or discussion. The Carpentries Executive Council is working on a rubric for deciding where The Carpentries would make a public statement about an organisation or event. We can use that rubric to look to see if the company has done something that would meet that criteria, and decide not to pursue a Sponsorship with them. If the questions are answered in good faith, agreement check boxes are checked and nothing against the rubric is found, we can likely move forward with Sponsorship. One way for final approval could be a vote from the CarpentryCon Sponsorship Task Force or a subcommittee responsible for evaluating applications.

#### Potential application questions

These are some potential application questions that could be used for the Sponsorship application. They should include links to the relevant information for the question. These are just suggestions for the types of things that may be appropriate. We encourage the relevant subcommittee to modify as needed or appropriate.

- Why is it that you would like to sponsor CarpentryCon 2020?
- The Carpentries vision is to be the leading inclusive community  teaching computing and data skills. How does that align with your organisation? This may be with respect to internal operation or your external work.
- If you’ve had any previous engagement with the Carpentries community, what are the details of your past involvement with The Carpentries?
- What are the ways that you would like to support The Carpentries' mission and goals?
- The Carpentries Code of Conduct and Values are core to our work and community. We acknowledge that we are aware of The Carpentries Code of Conduct and Values and that we are expected to follow them in all online and in-person Carpentries spaces. [Checkbox]
- *This language would need legal review*: We understand that The Carpentries have the right to turn down the application of an organisation or disassociate with a Sponsoring organisation if we find they are not in compliance with our Code of Conduct or Sponsorship policy. [checkbox]

### Sponsorship Agreement

When an organisation becomes a sponsor, they will need to sign a Sponsorship Agreement. This is particularly important, because of The Carpentries interest in being able to disassociate from a sponsor if certain conditions are met. RLadies, the Python Software Foundation or other aligned organisations may already have Sponsorship agreements that could be a starting point for The Carpentries Sponsorship agreement. This agreement will need to be reviewed by someone with legal expertise and likely approved by The Carpentries fiscal sponsor.

### Sponsorship Policy

The Carpentries should have ‘Sponsorship Policy’ language on the CarpentryCon sponsorship page that outlines all of these elements of sponsorship. Potential language can be adapted from the Python Software Foundation or other aligned organisations. Including this language gives us the ability to review applications and sets the expectation that we will do so.

Some potential language is provided below. This language would need legal review.

*Any organisation is welcome to apply for Sponsorship for CarpentryCon. Approval of Sponsorship is conditional on a review by the CarpentryCon Sponsorship Task Force, comprised of Carpentries volunteers and core team members.*

*The Carpentries is a non-profit project, obliging it to focus on its declared mission to promote the development of community and training in software and data. We therefore evaluate sponsors for alignment with our mission, values and Code of Conduct. Please fill out our Sponsorship application and your level of interest in Sponsorship. We’re grateful for your interest and excited for the potential opportunity to work with you.*

### General Sponsorship Requests

While we are planning to pilot sponsorships at CarpentryConnect 2020, we may in the meantime get interest in sponsorship or donations for The Carpentries organisation. We will not actively seek those sponsorships, and therefore won’t have a ‘Sponsorship packet’ or seek out sponsorship, but if they do come in, we can process and evaluate them through the same application process as a part of the pilot.

### Thanking Sponsors

We will need to thank sponsors. Some of that gratitude should be present in CarpentryCon 2020 itself. While much of this is already mapped out in the CarpentryCon Sponsorship Model document and website, this should be intentionally planned before the meeting.

We also should thank sponsors after the meeting, so we should plan to send them something physical, like a card and a picture from CarpentryCon. Additionally, sponsors will likely be interested in knowing the number of attendees and summaries of key results to understand the impact of their sponsorship. Aggregated public information in compliance with [our privacy policy](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/privacy.html) could be shared. The CarpentryCon Task Force can proactively identify the people or subcommittee who will be responsible for follow up with Sponsors after the meeting and what information or reports will be shared.  There is also the opportunity to continue engagement, by asking to add them to the list to receive the annual report. We’ll need an address to send information to, so we should plan to collect this information at the time of invoice. It may be a different person than the person who processes invoices.

### Evaluating the pilot

CarpentryCon 2020 is a pilot. How will we evaluate the success of this pilot? What are factors to consider?

These are a few suggestions, but the evaluation approach should be developed in parallel with the development of the program and be appropriate and relevant to the activities.

- Overall we should make a few surveys - for companies, for the sponsorship task force, and a few questions to go on the survey to conference participants
- How are companies feeling about the application process? Did they think it was straightforward and fair? Did anything about it make them more or less likely to Sponsor? Maybe create a survey for this.
- Did the company think this was a good use of their money? What value did they get?
- Did the committee have enough information to make decisions about whether people should be sponsors?
- Was the voting (or whatever mechanism is decided) effective for deciding on Sponsorship?
- Was the rubric useful in thinking about alignment with our values?
- Any adaptation needed for the Sponsorship Policy or agreement?
- What was community feedback around sponsorship? Did we get any positive or negative comments about our choices of sponsoring organisations or process?
- Did companies have any feedback about sponsorship generally? Did they have positive or negative comments about being a sponsor?
