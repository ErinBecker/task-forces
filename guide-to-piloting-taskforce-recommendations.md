# A Guide to Piloting Task Force Recommendations
The Carpentries uses Task Forces to explore ideas and make updates in policy, procedures and guidelines. Task forces bring together a small group of people focused on a particular topic for a set period of time. Task forces are proposed by the community, lesson programs, The Carpentries [core team](https://carpentries.org/team/), and/or Executive Council, and are approved by the Executive Council. More information about The Carpentries past and present task forces is located on our [task-forces repository](https://github.com/carpentries/task-forces).

A Task Force report is shared with the Executive Council upon completion of the work, and deliverables are developed and shared as outlined in the Task Force Charter. To aid task forces and those responsible with implementing recommendations that come out of a task force, the following roadmap/checklist was put together to help plan, pilot, and pursue task force recommendations.

# Plan. Pilot. Pursue.
This phrase (‘Plan. Pilot. Pursue.’) embodies how we do our work in The Carpentries and can be a core framework that we come back to when planning how we develop and pursue work that comes out of task force recommendations. The following roadmap/checklist will help with the planning and implementation of task force recommendations.

## Plan
Planning is not theoretical - it is practical. It will include trying things out, collecting feedback, and incorporating it into the pilot. Here are some steps to help plan the implementation of a task force recommendation:

- Identify the context of your project, task force, or initiative. Why are you doing this?
- Identify goals (aims) for your project, task force, or initiative. What do you want to achieve? 
- Identify anti-aims for your project, task force, or initiative. What will this project not cover/achieve?
- Identify key personnel (core team members, community members, contractors) to sit on your project team.
- Identify milestones for your project, task force, or initiative. What key tasks must be completed to move the project forward.
- Include dates, and be sure to factor in vacation/holidays and other priorities of your task force members.
- Identify metrics for your project, task force, or initiative. How will you know if this is successful?
- Identify budgetary items. Will you be making a purchase? Contracting out infrastructure work or a consultant?

## Pilot
Piloting is important because plans seldom survive on first attempt. There will always be things we miss or misunderstand. Going through a pilot phase means that we are thoughtful in reaching out to communities and understanding how something works, for minimal disruption to our community and positive impact. It also means we can decide not to do something, or make significant changes. 

Piloting means embracing the ‘learning’ part of who we are, and being explicit in asking for and incorporating feedback. Piloting does not only apply to a program or process. It can also apply to tasks such as writing reports, implementing a new workflow, or giving a talk. Synonyms for pilot in the context of the work that we do are practice, test, explore, try, model, draft, prepare, and make ready. Here are some things to consider for a pilot:

- Identify multiple communities/regions to involve in your pilot project, task force, or initiative. 
- Identify multiple pathways of participating in your pilot project, task force, or initiative.
- Identify mechanisms to receive and act on feedback.
  - Mechanisms should include multiple pathways to give/receive feedback, taking into account reaching communities with low to no bandwidth.
  - Initiating a request for comments/feedback.

## Pursue
Pursuing is important, because it means we are ready to launch ‘the thing’! Our planning and piloting has prepared us to go forward. Pursing embodies the ‘we are never finished’ mentality, because we keep pursuing that goal. We ‘release and iterate’! Once we incorporate feedback from the pilot, it is now time to pursue it! This means continuously onboarding the core team and community about the ‘new thing’. This looks like:

- Releasing and iterating on the project at least quarterly.  
- Giving the talk  
- Publishing the report  
- Updating the handbook  
- Onboarding the new committee
